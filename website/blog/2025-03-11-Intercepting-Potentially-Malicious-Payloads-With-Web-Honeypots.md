It has been silent around here as of late, but for good reason: we're starting the year (a bit late) with a presentation on web honeypots!
Join us Monday, the 17th of March, for "Intercepting Potentially Malicious Payloads with Web Honeypots".
The presentation will take you through all the steps you need to follow if you want to do this yourself: Docker containers, Elastic Stack, some good SysDevOps practices...

... But we know you are here for the threat intelligence, so don't worry, there will be some of that too, but only for your eyes.

Don't miss out! Register [here](https://indico.upb.ro/event/2/) and we'll send you an invite!
