Everybody knows the Internet is full of crawlers, bots, scanners and other opportunistic traffic. This is not breaking news, but sometimes you come across a scanner so aggressive it makes you think you are actively targeted for a second.

We first noticed this particularly aggressive scan on our support ticketing platform during September 2024, with over 18 000 requests in the span of 20 minutes from `52.86.221.173`.

```shell-session
[root@server tmp]# cat osticket_syslog.txt | grep 52.86.221.173 | grep 2024-09-07 | less | wc -l
18546
```

The scanner was fuzzing the new ticket form, but it couldn't figure out how to use the CSRF token, since all the logs were for an invalid CSRF token.

```

```

What makes it obvious this is just an aggressive scan and not a targeted attack is the lack of technology identification. The attempts ranged from XSS and SQL injection to SSTI and path traversals. There were even some Log4j exploitation attempts in there.

[...]
```

Taking a look at the IP the requests were coming from, we can see it belongs to AWS, most probably an EC2 instance.

## Takeaway

It's probably safe to say that you can block this IP without any issues. If it doesn't impact your users you can even block the entire AWS IP block, or even more datacenter IPs through [blocklists like the ones provided by FireHOL](https://iplists.firehol.org/?ipset=datacenters#), but double check that there are no exceptions you need to account for.
