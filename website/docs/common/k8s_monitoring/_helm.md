## The Helm package manager

Before deploying the Prometheus and Grafana monitoring tools in Kubernetes, we will have to install [Helm](https://helm.sh/), which is a package manager for Kubernetes.

We are doing this because Helm provides the simplest method for deploying complex software in Kubernetes, via Helm charts (a fancy name for packages).

Install Helm in the VM, using the instructions in the [User Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).
