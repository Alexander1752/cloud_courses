## What is Kafka?

**Apache Kafka** is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Originally developed at LinkedIn and later open-sourced through the Apache Software Foundation, Kafka is designed for high-throughput, low-latency handling of real-time data feeds.

The key features that Kafka provide are:
- **High throughput**: Kafka can handle millions of messages per second
- **Scalability**: Kafka clusters can scale horizontally by adding more brokers and partitions
- **Durability**: Data is persisted on disk and replicated across multiple brokers for fault tolerance

We will explain each keyword in the following chapters.

## Why do we need Kafka?

**Kafka** is used entensively across industries and domains that require real-time data streaming, reliable data pipelines and scalable system architectures.

Here is a list of companies that use Kafka in their tech stack:
1. Netflix
    * monitors streaming quality and buffer times
    * delivers recommendations based on recent watch history
    * trigger adaptive bitrate switching based on network conditions 
2. Riot Games (League of Legends)
    * track millions of in-game events per second
    * analyze performance, gameplay balance and user engagement
    * push live updates without interrupting gameplay
3. Uber
    * tracks driver location for live updates
    * updates trip status (driver on the way, trip completed)
    * ETA calculations, route updates and dynamic pricing (surge)
