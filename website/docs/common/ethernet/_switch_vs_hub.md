## Switch vs Hub

We want to study the differences between a switch and a hub. We will simulate packet forwarding between hosts using a Packet Tracer topology in which there are 2 networks with 4 computers each. The difference between the topologies is the interconnecting device: one uses a switch and the other uses a hub.

Wait for the ports in the switch to light green (not orange) and then send packets between any 2 computers in the 2 topologies to make sure there is connectivity (lights will remain orange for about 30 seconds until STP - Spanning Tree Protocol - converges).

Once you have checked for connectivity, go into Simulation mode and send a packet between 2 computers. Do this for both networks. Observe which packets are generated on the network in each case.

What is the difference between the switch and the hub?

At what level in the OSI stack do they each run?
