### Troubleshooting connectivity problem

We aim to troubleshoot a connectivity issue. To "generate" the problem run the preparation script with the new argument ex7:
```shell-command
root@host:~# start_lab ip ex7
```

:::tip
For troubleshooting, the recommended first step is to display the routing table. The routing table will help you troubleshoot if certain entries are missing or misconfigured.

:::note
Check connectivity between all stations in the topology. Notice that there is no connectivity between any station and the blue station. Troubleshoot connectivity issues to the blue station on the host station.

Identify and resolve issues.
