# Virtualization in cloud

:::note
This lab has two sections - one for native virtualization, and one for cloud virtualization
in OpenStack. For the second section you will create the virtual machines from
the command line, and not the web interface.

# Native virtualization

import NVkvm from '../common/native_virt/_native_virt_kvm.md';

<NVkvm/>


# OpenStack

import OSsetup from '../common/openstack/_setup.md';

<OSsetup/>

import OSmanage from '../common/openstack/_management.md';
