## Task 5 - 15p

When you have your nginx + Prometheus + Grafana setup up and running, check how
the graphs change when you have a high load on your web server compared to when
there is a light load.

To do this, run some Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks against the nginx web server
using a tool such as [slowhttptest](https://github.com/shekyan/slowhttptest) or any
other tool you find suitable.

If you are using `slowhttptest`, you can find a tutorial on how it can be used
[here](https://github.com/shekyan/slowhttptest/wiki/InstallationAndUsage#usage).

See how things change in the Grafana Dashboard. Take a few screen captures (before, during
and after the attack), add them to a document and briefly present some conclusions you can
reach by observing the Grafana Dashboard (max half page).


## Task 6 (Bonus) - up to 20p

For the `nginx-Prometheus-Grafana` setup you have implemented, propose what
security-related actions should be added to secure your web server and your
infrastructure.

## Homework submission

To submit your homework, you have to upload on Moodle a zip archive named `SCGC - <Your LDAP username here>.zip` (e.g. `SCGC - ana.popescu3342.zip` that contains the following
files:
  - The Manifests you used to deploy your Kubernetes containers.
  - A screenshot with each solved task.
  - A write-up on how your infrastructure should be reproduced (any ramp-up scripts work as well) and tested.
  - A pdf file containing a write-up, screenshots for all solved tasks and the written text for tasks 5 and 6. This pdf file must be named `Proposed Solution - <Your LDAP
username here>.pdf` (e.g., `Proposed Solution - ana.popescu3342.pdf`).
  - A README file.

The deadline for submitting your zip archive is the 26th of May 2024, 23:55.

## Homework presentation

The homework must be presented during the remaining laboratories (until 28th of May 2024) or during the last course (28th of May 2024). You will have to briefly present what and how you have set up for your infrastructure and demonstrate that it
works. The homework presentation is mandatory. You will not receive a grade on your homework if you do not present it.
