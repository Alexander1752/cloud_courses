# Name services (DNS)

## Setup

We will be using a virtual machine in the [faculty's cloud](http://cloud.grid.pub.ro/).

When creating a virtual machine in the Launch Instance window:
  * Select **Boot from image** in **Instance Boot Source** section
  * Select **SCGC Template 2021** in **Image Name** section
  * Select the **m1.large** flavor.

In the base virtual machine:
  * Download the laboratory archive from [here](https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/scgc/laboratoare/lab-dns.zip) in the `work` directory.
Use: `wget --user=user-curs --ask-password http://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/scgc/laboratoare/lab-dns.zip` to download the archive.
Replace `user-curs` with your LDAP username. The password is your LDAP password.
  * Extract the archive.
The `.qcow2` files will be used to start virtual machines using the `runvm.sh` script.
  * Start the virtual machines using `bash runvm.sh`.
  * The username for connecting to the nested VMs is `student` and the password is `student`.
  * For ease of use we recommend adding entries in the `/etc/hosts` file corresponding to the two VMs:
    * `192.168.100.11 dns`
    * `192.168.100.12 helper`
    * These two lines will allow using `dns` instead of the IP address of the DNS VM for clarity. Likewise, we can use `helper` instead of the IP address of the helper VM.

## Security of DNS Servers
DNS is a critical infrastructure and it is one of the most desired hosts to be compromised.
Some common attacks on the DNS servers are:
 * DNS Spoofing: A MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attack where a malicious host acts like a
legitimate DNS server and serves another IP for the desired domain.
 * DoS Attacks: by flooding the DNS servers with random domains (when recursive queries
are allowed) or random subdomains, the DNS server will not respond to legitimate queries.
 * DNS Hijacking

## DNSSEC

DNS is vulnerable to MITM attacks.
An attacker can pretend to be a DNS server and supply an unsuspecting victim with
the wrong IP address for a URL. In order to combat this, DNSSEC can be used and
configured to validate the identity of the DNS server.

Using the instructions from [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-dnssec-on-an-authoritative-bind-dns-server--2),
setup DNSSEC for your DNS server.
