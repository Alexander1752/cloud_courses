Pair up with one of your peers.
Each student will make the necessary changes in order for his master DNS server
to be delegated the DNS zone of his colleague's master DNS server.
You should be able to answer for queries about each others DNS domains.

## DNSSEC

DNS is vulnerable to MITM attacks.
An attacker can pretend to be a DNS server and supply an unsuspecting victim with
the wrong IP address for a URL. In order to combat this, DNSSEC can be used and
configured to validate the identity of the DNS server.

Using the instructions from [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-dnssec-on-an-authoritative-bind-dns-server--2),
setup DNSSEC between the master and slave VM.
