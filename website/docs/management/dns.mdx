## Setup

We will be using a virtual machine in the [faculty's cloud](http://cloud.grid.pub.ro/).

When creating a virtual machine in the Launch Instance window:
  * Select **Boot from image** in **Instance Boot Source** section
  * Select **SCGC Template 2021** in **Image Name** section
  * Select the **m1.large** flavor.

In the base virtual machine:
  * Download the laboratory archive from **TODO URL** in the `work` directory.
  * Extract the archive. You will see multiple `.qcow2` files and two scripts: `lab-dns-start.sh` and `lab-dns-stop.sh`.
The `.qcow2` files will be used to start virtual machines using the `lab-dns-start.sh` script. To stop the virtual machine,
you can use `lab-dns-stop.sh`.
  * Start the helper virtual machines using `./lab-dns-start.sh`.
  * The username for connecting to the nested VMs is `student` and the password is `student`.
  * For ease of use we recommend adding entries in the `/etc/hosts` file corresponding to the two VMs:
    * `192.168.1.1 dns`
    * `192.168.1.2 helper`
    * These two lines will allow using `dns` instead of the IP address of the DNS VM for clarity. Likewise, we can use `helper` instead of the IP address of the helper VM.
  * For accessing the two VMs, connect to them using SSH from the base machine (username is **student**).

## Paired DNS zone transfer
Pair up with one of your peers.
Each student will make the necessary changes in order for his master DNS server
to be delegated the DNS zone of his colleague's master DNS server.
You should be able to answer for queries about each others DNS domains.

## DNSSEC

DNS is vulnerable to MITM attacks.
An attacker can pretend to be a DNS server and supply an unsuspecting victim with
the wrong IP address for a URL. In order to combat this, DNSSEC can be used and
configured to validate the identity of the DNS server.

Using the instructions from [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-setup-dnssec-on-an-authoritative-bind-dns-server--2),
setup DNSSEC between the dns and helper VM.
