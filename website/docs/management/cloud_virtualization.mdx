# Virtualization in cloud

:::note
This lab has two sections - one for native virtualization, and one for cloud virtualization
in OpenStack. For the second section you will create the virtual machines from
the command line, and not the web interface.
:::

# Native virtualization

import NVkvm, {toc as NVkvmTOC} from '../common/native_virt/_native_virt_kvm.md';

<NVkvm/>


# OpenStack

import OSsetup, {toc as OSsetupTOC} from '../common/openstack/_setup.md';

<OSsetup/>

import OSmanage, {toc as OSmanageTOC} from '../common/openstack/_management.md';

<OSmanage/>

export const toc = [...NVkvmTOC, ...OSsetupTOC, ...OSmanageTOC]
