# CI/CD

## Setup

We will be using a virtual machine in the [faculty's cloud](http://cloud.grid.pub.ro/).

When creating a virtual machine in the Launch Instance window:
  * Name your VM using the following convention: `cc_lab<no>_<username>`,
where `<no>` is the lab number and `<username>` is your institutional account.
  * Select **Boot from image** in **Instance Boot Source** section
  * Select **CC 2024-2025** in **Image Name** section
  * Select the **m1.xlarge** flavor.

In the base virtual machine:
  * Download the laboratory archive from [here](https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/cc/laboratoare/lab-ci-cd.zip).
Use: `wget https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/cc/laboratoare/lab-ci-cd.zip` to download the archive.
  * Extract the archive.
  * Run the setup script `bash lab-ci-cd.sh`.

```shell-session
$ # download the archive
$ wget https://repository.grid.pub.ro/cs/cc/laboratoare/lab-ci-cd.zip
$ unzip lab-ci-cd.zip
$ # run setup script; it may take a while
$ bash lab-ci-cd.sh
```

## Before we start

:::info
If you do not have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, create one before starting this laboratory. It will be used to interact with a repository and create the CI/CD pipeline in it.
